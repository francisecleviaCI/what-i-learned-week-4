# what-i-learned-in-week-4
It's *only* been 5 weeks!
___
This week we learned how to select specific characters from a 'string'(a.k.a. word), how to count the digits in a string, and what index/indices are. Counting characters and indices reinforced counting from 'zero' which still doesn't feel second nature.

We also completed our first application which was a basic Celsius to Fahrenheit calculator. This exericse also integrated output statements and developed some familiarity with 'console.log' which take a variable and its stored information and displays it in the terminal.

Boolean is a data type where its only output can be true or false. We can take one or more statements and design them to respond true or false based on the conditions that we desire.    

**Thoughts**
1. Started to write more 'comments' into the code to help me remember/learn what the specificing line means. Didn't really think about doing that before Mesi gave that advice.
